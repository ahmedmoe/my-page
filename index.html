<h2>The Essay on Hamlet</h2>
<p>There are not many souls that live a selfless life. This play that Shakespeare created with his heart and soul tells us the story of one such soul that never existed yet whose story and character might inspire some to idealize and replicate. People make sacrifices. Hamlet makes sacrifices too but their beauty comes from the way he executes them, which renders the observers immune to their fragrance. In order to see the theme of sacrifice that is portrayed in this play, we must first establish the selfless nature of Hamlets actions and the way in which they are deleterious to his self.</p>

<p>It can be seen from the play that Hamlet has a desire to avenge his late father and kill Claudius. Is this desire selfish or sefless? In the end of the play Hamlet is able to kill Claudius and get his revenge, but he himself dies in the process. At first glance it seems as if Hamlet got his revenge but unfortunately, he did not have enough time to savor this victory. It can be seen from the play that this is not the case. When Hamlet starts this mission, he knows what he is getting into. At several points in the play we see that he has to undergo humiliation and shame yet he does not give up his so-called ‘desire for revenge’. If that is true, then it begs the question, why would Hamlet try to achieve a selfish goal, the path to which leads to his own doom? This gives us an idea that there was more than just one motive that made Hamlet walk into the arms of death. Hamlet does feel sad due to the loss of his father and there is little doubt that this loss engenders hatred in him for Claudius and also a desire to exact retribution. At the same time, Hamlet sees Claudius as someone who does not respect familial ties and a greedy person who does not have enough patience to even put up a pretense to grief for a brother he lost. To put it into simple words, we see that Hamlet looks at Claudius and sees an incarnation of disaster. Someone not fit to sit a throne which his father maintained very efficiently. Thus Hamlet’s utmost dedication to remove Claudius from the throne sounds very much like a desire for vengeance but in my opinion, I believe it is his desire to save the throne from Claudius and corruption. To achieve this he is prepared to go to any lengths, even to give his own life. We see this indeed comes to happen as in the end, Hamlet has to make the ultimate sacrifice.</p>

<p>Hamlet sacrifices his pride for the sake of his mission. Hamlet is one of noble birth, the sworn prince of Denmark. His stature makes him the centre of attention for many people. With stature comes pride. We see in the novel that Hamlet pretends to be insane. Hamlet has to feign madness for many reasons. He wants to distract others from his investigation into his father’s death. He wants to show himself harmless to those who might see his anti-Claudius efforts as a threat. At the same time he knows the cost of this pretense. He would face humiliation, mockery and would be subject of most ruthless gossip. And worst of all, Hamlet realizes the derogatory impact of this pretense on his pride, yet still he wears the mask of lunacy. And this again points to theme of sacrifice in the play. For someone with the stature and respect of Hamlet, one can empathize with the vast struggle or will power that might be required to throw away all the comforts of pride in order to achieve one goal. Thus Hamlet sacrifices his image and pride.</p>

<p>Hamlet loves his father deeply. After his meeting with the ghost of his father, Hamlet decides to dedicate all his efforts to avenge his father’s murder. He wants to fulfill the last wish that is made to him by his father’s ghost and in that struggle he sacrifices everything else. Hamlet’s dedication for this cause can be glimpsed from his following quotation:</p>

<p class="quote">Yea, from the table of my memory</p>
<p class="quote">I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,</p>
<p class="quote">All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,</p>
<p class="quote">That youth and observation copied there;</p>
<p class="quote">And thy commandment all alone shall live</p>
<p class="quote">Within the book and volume of my brain,</p>
<p class="quote">Unmix'd with baser matter</p>

<p>The quotation shows how Hamlet is ready to abnegate all comforts to put the ghost’s commandment or his request to avenge his murder from Claudius foremost in his mind before all other worldly matters. The quotation also introduces very strong imagery. For instance Hamlet talks about deleting all records and books and other knowledge that he gained as a youth from his mind’s storage. This imagery also accentuates Hamlet’s devotion to his new found aim and his will to sacrifice.</p>

<p>Hamlet sacrifices the one last colorful aspect of his life, a pillar that supports his sanity: his love for Ophelia. After He sets upon the path of vengeance, his relations with Ophelia are initially good. Soon Hamlet comes to realize the danger which this relation would pose to Ophelia. He does not want to involve her in this conflict and also realizes that as long as she is related to him, she would be dragged in this matter one way or another. Hamlet’s fear indeed comes to pass as Polonius uses Ophelia to spy on Him and reports back directly to the king. From the play we get the idea that Hamlet truly does love Ophelia and he does not want her to be manipulated. Thus to ensure her safety he distances from her. Hamlet’s breaking all his bonds with Ophelia might seem like an attempt to stop himself from being spied on which again reinforces the selfless nature of this noble sacrifice. He truly deceives Ophelia into believing that he actually never loved her. Here we see once again how Hamlet does not want others to feel his pain as he shatters his last tether to sanity for the fulfillment of his goal.</p>

<p>Hamlet sacrifices his future prospects to ascend the throne. Hamlet is a character who really does not care about being the one in control. He wishes to slay Claudius but he does not do it for obtaining the throne. This idea again reinforces our understanding of Hamlet’s selfless conscience that sacrifices all worldly matters for his one sole purpose.</p>

<p>Hamlet is not the only character who shoulder’s the heavy theme of sacrifice that is embedded in the play. Another character that accepts the burden and pain of sacrifice is Hamlet’s mother, Gertrude. Gertrude is a character who loves Hamlet and is always ready to sacrifice all her happiness for her him. Gertrude is seduced by Claudius and the way she is happy in her marriage with him shows us her contentment with this marriage. Yet after her encounter with Hamlet, she switches to his side the moment he tells her his plan. She is aware of the negative affect this would have on her marriage with Claudius but she does not care about that at all. Gertrude goes along with Hamlet’s plan which ultimately leads in her demise. Here again the example of a character is before us, who much like Hamlet sacrifices her most important things for the sake of those they love. Ophelia resembles Gertrude in this way as she much like Gertrude sacrifices her relationship with Hamlet for her father’s affection.</p>

<p>Despite all the darker themes present in the play Hamlet, it is a play brimming with sacrifices and other acts of sympathy. Hamlet is a character whose intentions are often veiled which makes his sacrifices all the more selfless. Hamlet is able to avenge his father at the end but to say that he did not get enough time to savor his victory, would be a false assumption. Hamlet’s main intentions are not to avenge, rather he works under a will to save his country. Hamlet sacrifices his time and energy and offers his utmost dedication and concentration towards his goals and in the end he even sacrifices his life.</p>
